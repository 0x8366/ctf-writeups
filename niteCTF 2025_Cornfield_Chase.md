## Challenge

For Nite CTF 2025 we had a couple images we would have to geoguess and use a mini map to place a marker on the exact location or roughly within 250m.

## Solution

The location I was tasked with finding here was obviously in Taiwan. Having done a previous CTF with a very similar challenge. To find this spot I knew I had to located the pole, and in doing so used this really awesome tool

Basically, you just take the bottom two rows of numbers and enter that into the tool and it will give you the correct coordinates, pretty neat huh!
