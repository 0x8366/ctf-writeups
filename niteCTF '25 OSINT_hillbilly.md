## Challenge 

**Hillbilly**

For Nite CTF 2025 we had a couple images we would have to geoguess and use a mini map to place a marker on the exact location or roughly within 250m.

## Solution

For this image in the series of geoguessing for Nite CTF I focused on the big mountain you can see in the background. After quite a few google image searches I landed on a mountain in Crete that has a broadcasting center on top called Skloka Broadcasting Center. From there I went a little west and found the correct location.
