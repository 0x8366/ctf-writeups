## Challenge description

While attempting to locate evidence of Mr. X near the campsite where I had eaten, I encountered a second food stall in the vicinity. I was able to capture an image of the location; however, the establishment’s name was unintentionally removed during post-processing.

The objective was to use the remaining visual clues in the image to determine the actual camp where the meal took place.

## Solution

During initial inspection, I identified the text “Three Sheets Brewery” printed on an umbrella in the image. This provided a starting point: a quick Google search for the brewery, which led to a matching business located in Toronto, Canada.

From there, I searched the area in Google Maps and discovered a reference to Tacomory, a food truck operating in the region. Further image searches for Tacomory produced a publicly available photo that visually aligned with the challenge image. This supported the conclusion that the truck belonged to Tacomory, situated near the town of Tobermory.

As for the campground, there were a few in the area near Tacomory and one of them ended up being the correct one. 

**Flag:** `07CTF{Tobermory_Village_Campground}`

This was a first blood solve.
