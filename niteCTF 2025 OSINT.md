## Challenge 

**The Ashes**

For Nite CTF 2025 we had a couple images we would have to geoguess and use a mini map to place a marker on the exact location or roughly within 250m.

## Solution

Upon first inspection of the image I noticed letters on the trucks hood that spell out Ipswich. After a few minutes of research I understood the location would be 
near Ipswich Australia. The truck is on a trail surrounded by trees so I figured it was in an area with lots of trees and trails which led me to the White Rock Spring Mountain Conservation area. My teammate/captain vivig
pointed out the powerlines above and on the map there is a long line where powerlines are and it led me to place the little pegman in google maps on a spot that ended up being the correct area.
