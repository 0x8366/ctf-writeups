## Methodology/Solution

The challenge image provided above was just the starting point here to get a general location: Stockholm, Sweden.

From there used the tool Sherlock to discover Willow1124's blog at: https://willow1124.blogspot.com

On the blog there is another image which is of Stockholm's Central Station. A couple key sentences stood out in the blog: *I was meeting Ken to eat sushi*, *the name of the place we’re meeting up at consists of four parts*, *I’d gotten off one stop too early*, and *gotta walk*. From there, I looked for the next closest stop which was Hötorget subway station.


I then looked around for a sushi restaurant that was four parts in name near Hötorget station and came across this place: `Soyokafe Sushi and Ramen`
https://www.soyokaze.se/soyokafe

This indeed was the correct location:
